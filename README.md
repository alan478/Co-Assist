Android COVID resource app with contact tracing, social distancing mapping, and VR social distancing "ruler".

[Devpost](https://devpost.com/software/covid_resource_app) for in depth description and video on project. 

## Description <h2>
Are you out in public but scared about people standing too close? Do you want to catch up on the social interactions at your cosy place but do not want to endanger your guests? Or you just want to be notified as soon as you have come in close contact to an infected individual? The Covid Resource App aims to bring a one-size-fits-all solution to the multifaceted issues that COVID-19 has spread in our everyday lives. 

Our app has 4 features, namely:
	<br>- A social distancing feature which allows you to track where the "6ft" distance lies
	<br>- A visual planner feature which allows you to verify how many people you can safely fit in an enclosed area
	<br>- A contact tracing feature that allows the app to keep a log of your close contacts for the past 14 days
	<br>- A self-reporting feature which enables you to notify your close contacts by email in case of a positive test result

With this app, we hope to provide the tools to users to navigate social distancing more easily amidst this worldwide pandemic.
